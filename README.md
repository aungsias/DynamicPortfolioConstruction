## Project Catalogue

- [DynamicAssetManagement](DynamicAssetManagement) - In this project, I engineered a dynamic, machine learning-driven framework for adaptive sector-based investment. Through biannual model recalibrations, the strategy remains agile, adjusting to market shifts and optimizing asset allocation. A 16-year backtest shows it outperforms traditional benchmarks like the S&P 500. The architecture, comprehensive yet adaptable, incorporates risk management via a custom loss function, making it suitable for long-only portfolios. I also discuss its limitations and propose avenues for future refinement.

- [NNBasedPortfolioOptimization](NNBasedPortfolioOptimization) - To be written.
