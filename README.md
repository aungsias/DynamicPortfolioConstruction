# Eigen
Welcome to ***Eigen***, an evolving repository showcasing my work primarily in finance and machine learning, with occasional forays into other business and economics domains. Created to archive and disseminate my ongoing endeavors, Eigen is subject to regular and frequent updates, both in content and structure.

# Content
The projects within this repository are comprehensive undertakings aimed at solving intricate business conundrums, often necessitating an interdisciplinary approach that amalgamates various sectors and knowledge bases. These serve as conduits for intellectual curiosity, designed to engender insights that are useful at the very minimum. Regardless of whichever project you peruse, I hope you walk away having learned at least something!

Feel free to explore, and thank you for taking the time to visit my repository.
