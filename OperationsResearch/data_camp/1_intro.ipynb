    "## Introduction to Linear and Integer Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition:** Linear programming (LP) is a method to achieve the best outcome in a mathematical model whose requirements are represented by linear relationships. Integer programming (IP) is a specific case of LP where the solution space is restricted to integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Key Difference:** LP allows continuous decision variables, while IP restricts variables to discrete values (integers).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Applications:** These techniques are widely used in business for resource allocation, logistics, scheduling, and maximizing efficiency or profit.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Components of a Linear Programming Model\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Decision Variables:** These are the variables whose values are to be determined in order to optimize the objective function.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Objective Function:** A linear function to be maximized or minimized (e.g., maximize profit, minimize cost).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Constraints:** Linear inequalities or equalities representing restrictions or limitations on the decision variables (e.g., resource limits, capacity constraints).\n",
    "\n",
    "Formulating a Linear Programming Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Identifying Decision Variables:** Understanding what quantities or factors need optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Setting up the Objective Function:** Determining what is to be optimized (cost, profit, time, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Defining Constraints** Identifying and mathematically formulating limitations or requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction to Integer Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Difference from LP:** In IP, decision variables are integers, which is crucial for problems where solutions are discrete (e.g., number of items, people).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Applications:** Used in situations where fractional answers are not practical (e.g., scheduling, manufacturing with batch restrictions)."
