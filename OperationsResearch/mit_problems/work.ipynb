David Ortiz is batting for the Red Sox. What pitch should Rivera throw? How should David Ortiz bat? In this simplified version of the problem, Rivera can throw one of three pitches: a high inside fastball, a high outside fastball, or a high inside curve. Ortiz can prepare for the pitch by expecting a curveball or a fastball. The probability of Ortiz scoring a run is given in Table 1. If he doesn’t score a run, then he is out, and the inning ends.\n",
